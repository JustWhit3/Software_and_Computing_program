# USEFUL INFORMATIONS
 
## List of the documents in the repository (except this):

- "General_Informations.md": contains general informations about the program written with Python 3.

- "PDF_dataset.pdf": it's the pdf to which I inxpired for the writing of the code. It contains also more technical informations 
about the AMS score and others.

- "Program.ipynb": it's the main program written with Python 3.

## Important information:

This program was born as a collaboration between me and another collegue from Germany. We started working on this project
without using the Control Version correctly. So at the end I put things in order and added all the versions (from the 
first one, to the last one) in the repository. In the description of each update of each version I added on the top the real
date in which I applyied all the changes to the program.
