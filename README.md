## List of the folders in the repository

- [Explanations](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Software_and_Computing_program/tree/master/Explanations): this folder contains all the documents related to the explanations of the analysis from a physical point of
view. In this, you will not find explicit references to the code or to the technical aspects of the project, but only theoretical explanations.

- "How-to guides": this folder contains all the guides necessary to execute the program in your device and to reproduce the same simulation in your dataset.

- "Project": this folder contains the whole code of the project and some graphs and informations related to the representation of the final results.

- "Reference guides": this folder contains all the reference guides related to understand how work all the functions and classes defined in the project.

NOTE: for each folder there is a proper README.md file that explains in detail what are the documents inside it and what they do.

## Important information

This program was born as a collaboration between me and another collegue from Germany. We started working on this project
without using the Control Version correctly. So at the end I put things in order and added all the previous versions of the project in the repository. In the description of each update of each version of the program, I added on the top the real date in which I applyied all the changes to the project itself. The latter procedure has been performed only on the versions before the 23th of March 2020; than, it would no longer be necessary.
