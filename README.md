## Important information

This program was born as a collaboration between me and another collegue from Germany. We started working on this project
without using the Control Version correctly. So at the end I put things in order and added all the previous versions of the project in the repository. In the description of each update of each version of the program, I added on the top the real date in which I applyied all the changes to the project itself. The latter procedure has been performed only on the versions before the 23th of March 2020; than, it would no longer be necessary.
