## Project folder
### General informations
This folder contains all the informations related to the code and the results of the project itself.

### List of the documents in the folder

- [Program.ipynb](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Software_and_Computing_program/blob/master/Project/Program.ipynb): this document contains the whole code of the project. You can understand how to execute this on your device, by simply reading the "How-to guides".

- [s_c_final_AMS.png](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Software_and_Computing_program/blob/master/Project/s_c_final_AMS.png): contains the graph of the final AMS, obtained from the combnation of the AMS from the BDT and the DNNs outputs, with a comparison with them.

- [s_c_unweighted.png](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Software_and_Computing_program/blob/master/Project/s_c_unweighted.png): contains the unweighted histogram for the final representation of the discrimination between signal and background data. From the physical point of view is not useful, but could be nice to show also it.

- [s_c_weighted.png](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Software_and_Computing_program/blob/master/Project/s_c_weighted.png): contains the weighted histogram for the final representation of the discrimination between signal and background data. This is more useful and correct from the physical point of view.

- [distributions_variables](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Software_and_Computing_program/blob/master/Project/distributions_variables.png): this contains an example of the distributions of the new variables after applying feature enginnering on them.

### Final AMS result
Final results of the analysis are:
+ The best AMS Score of the DNN is 3.529 at a Cut Parameter of 0.83.
+ The best AMS Score of the BDT is 3.578 at a Cut Parameter of 0.83.
+ The combination of the two AMS scores is 3.652 at a Cut Parameter of 0.88.
